    <h2 id="supremecourt">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</h2>
      <h3>What do they do?</h3>
        <p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is a 7 member body that rules on cases presented to them by the Pennsylvania Appellate Court (where people go to appeal their case at a lower level). They get about 3,000 court requests a year from the appellate courts to rule on. They also have boards and committees to enforce rules for lower level courts and attorneys. The only court to overturn the PA Supreme Court is the US Supreme Court.</p>
      <h3>How long is their term?</h3>
        <p>10 years.</p>
      <h3>How much are they paid annually?</h3>
        <p>$215,037</p>

    <h2 id="superiorcourt">Pennsylvania Superior Court</h2>
      <h3>What do they do?</h3>
        <p>This is one of the two intermediate appellate courts (alongside the Commonwealth Court) in Pennsylvania. This 3 judge court rules on cases that are appealed from the Courts of Common Pleas (county level courts). Most of the time, this court is the final ruling on these appeals unless it is taken up by the PA Supreme Court.</p>

    <h2 id="commonwealthcourt">Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court</h2>
      <h3>What do they do?</h3>
        <p>This is one of the two intermediate appellate courts (alongside the Superior Court) in Pennsylvania. This 9-judge panel court focuses on actions done by the government and regulatory bodies such as with banking, utility regulation, taxation laws, elections, and labor. It also is where cases filed against the Pennsylvania State Government are heard. Appeals are usually heard only by 3 judges at a time. The president of the Commonwealth Court has a 5 year term and is elected by their colleagues.</p>

    <h2 id="ballotquestion1">Ballot Question 1:<br> Article 3, Section 9 Constitutional Amendment</h2>
      <h3>Ballot Question:</h3>
      <p><em>"Shall the Pennsylvania Constitution be amended to change existing law and increase the power of the General Assembly to unilaterally terminate or extend a disaster emergency declaration--and the powers of Commonwealth agencies to address the disaster regardless of its severity pursuant to that declaration--through passing a concurrent resolution by simple majority, thereby removing the existing check and balance of presenting a resolution to the Governor for approval or disapproval?"</em></p>
      <h3>What is the current system?</h3>
      <p>Bills and Resolutions passing the State House and State Assembly are presented to the Governor to be approved or vetoed. If vetoed, then 2/3 of the House and Assembly must vote to overturn the veto. Currently only Alaska, Kansas, Michigan, and Minnesota allow the legislature to pass legislation to extend or overturn a governor's emergency declarations.<p>
      <h3>What caused the change?</h3>
      <p>The State legislature passed a resolution attempting to end the Governor's COVID-19 emergency declarations such as stay-at-home orders and school and business restrictions. The PA State Supreme Court ruled that the Governor could veto the resolution to end the emergency declaration. However, when the veto was attempted to be overturned, it did not meet the 2/3 majority required.</p>
      <h3>If passed, what would it do?</h3>
      <p>This would allow the PA State Assembly and State Senate to vote to end the emergency declaration with a 1/2 majority vote and the governor would be prevented from vetoing it.</p>
      <h3>Yes/For the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increases legislature's power to end or continue emergency declarations</li>
        <li>Decreases the governor's powers to extend emergency declarations during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
        <li>Reduces the authority of who can create and end disaster emergency declarations</li>
        <li>Removes the 2/3 vote requirement to overturn the governor's veto for resolutions ending emergency declarations</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>No/Against the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces the power of an elected official to act in an emergency and coordinate with the relevant PA agencies</li>
        <li>Increases partisan influence during emergency responses</li>
        <li>Creates logistical and administrative blocks for overseeing disasters and coordination efforts</li>
        <li>Maintains the checks-and-balance structure that is common in most government structures in the process to override vetoes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote yes for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>If you vote YES, you DO want to give the Legislature, by a 1/2 majority vote, the sole power to take away the Governor’s existing authority to make disaster emergency declarations and coordinate with relevant Pennsylvania agencies.</p>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote no for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>If you vote NO, you DO NOT want to give the Legislature, by a 1/2 majority vote, the sole power to take away the Governor’s existing authority to make disaster emergency declarations and coordinate with relevant Pennsylvania agencies.</p>

    <h2 id="ballotquestion2">Ballot Question 2:<br> Article 4 Constitutional Amendment</h2>
      <h3>Ballot Question:</h3>
      <p><em>"Shall the Pennsylvania Constitution be amended to change existing law so that: a disaster emergency declaration will expire automatically after 21 days, regardless of the severity of the emergency, unless the General Assembly takes action to extend the disaster emergency; the Governor may not declare a new disaster emergency to respond to the dangers facing the Commonwealth unless the General Assembly passes a concurrent resolution; the General Assembly enacts new laws for disaster management?"</em></p>
      <h3>What is the current system?</h3>
      <p>Currently Emergency Declarations declared by the Governor last 90 days. The PA State Assembly and State Senate can end the disaster emergency declaration with a concurrent resolution. Then if vetoed, overturned it and end the disaster emergency declaration with a 2/3 majority.</p>
      <h3>What caused the change?</h3>
      <p>Similar to Ballot Question 1, this was inspired by the PA State Supreme Court ruling that stated that Governor Wolf could veto the concurrent resolution passed by the PA State Legislature that would end the diaster emergency declarations and end restrictions from being implemented.</p>
      <h3>If passed, what would it do?</h3>
      <p>This would reduce the time that a disaster emergency declaration would be implemented from 90 to 21 days unless the State Legislature extends it. It would also prevent the Governor from declaring new disaster emergencies unless the General Assembly passes a concurrent resolution allowing the governor to do that.</p>
      <h3>Yes/For the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gives the legislature, which is elected by the people in individual districts, the power to manage a disaster</li>
        <li>Limits the emergency declaration down to 21 days from 90 unless extended by the General Assembly</li>
        <li>Removes the traditional 2/3 legislative vote to overturn a veto on emergency declarations</li>
        <li>Strips the power to extend a declaration from the governor and gives it to the legislature</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>No/Against the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creates a logistical hurdle to convene a 253-member legislature in disaster conditions every 21 days</li>
        <li>Reduces the power of the executive branch to act in an emergency </li>
        <li>Increases partisan influence on emergency response</li>
        <li>Could lead to delays worsening the impacts of a disaster</li>
        <li>Hurts the state government's ability to access federal government aid</li>
        <li>Creates uncertainity over the appropriate response due to a shortened timeframe</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote yes for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting YES means that you DO SUPPORT limiting the Governor's emergency declaration no matter how severe from 90 days to 21. You also would SUPPORT only allowing the extention of the disaster emergency declaration upon both the PA State Senate and State Assembly providing their approval. You also would SUPPORT the General Assembly being the only ones to act to implement disaster management policy.</p>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote no for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting NO means that you DO NOT SUPPORT limiting the Governor's emergency declaration to only 21 days and WANT TO ALLOW the governor to retain their power to enact policy in emergency and disasters.</p>

    <h2 id="ballotquestion3">Ballot Question 3: Article 1 Constitutional Amendment</h2>
      <h3>Ballot Question:</h3>
      <p><em>"Shall the Pennsylvania Constitution be amended by adding a new section providing that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of an individual's race or ethnicity?"</em></p>
      <h3>What is the current system?</h3>
      <p>Currently under Article 1, Section 26 of the PA Constitution, it prohibits discrimination by the Pennsylvania governement “against any person in the exercise of any civil right.” The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution and other federal laws also provide protection against discrimination as well.
      <h3>What caused the change?</h3>
      <p>This was introduced following the police violence cases and subsequent protests that were more prevelant in Summer 2020.</p>
      <h3>If passed, what would it do?</h3>
      <p>This would allow for "reverse discrimination" cases to be heard. For example, if passed, a Caucasian individual could sue if they felt discriminated against by the State-run operation or agency in hiring, admissions, or denied opportunities.</p>
      <h3>Yes/For the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Promotes the right of the state to act independently from the US Constitution and Federal Laws</li>
        <li>Specifies the definition of racial and ethnic discrimination under state law</li>
        <li>Could eliminate preferential treatment of under-represented groups (Affirmative Action) by PA State government entites and institutions</li>
        <li>Prevents future legislation from being implemented that would provide preferential treatment for under-represented groups on the grounds of race or ethnicity</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>No/Against the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This would allow "reverse discrimination" cases to be heard such as Caucasian individual could sue the state for racial discrimination against the PA government</li>
        <li>Removes affirmative action policies which support providing equitable treatment across racial and ethnic groups in hiring, admissions, contracting, and access to opportunites</li>
        <li>Current PA Constition prevents discrimination "against any person in the exercise of any civil right"</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote yes for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting YES means that you DO SUPPORT allowing "reverse discrimination" cases and SUPPORT the possibility of BANNING affirmative action policies enacted by the state government.</p>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote no for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting NO means that you DO NOT SUPPORT allowing for "reverse discrimination" cases and DO NOT SUPPORT the possibility of BANNING affirmative action policies enacted by the state government.</p>

    <h2 id="ballotquestion4">Ballot Question 4: Referendum</h2>
      <h3>Ballot Question:</h3>
      <p><em>"Do you favor expanding the use of the indebtedness authorized under the referendum for loans to volunteer fire companies, volunteer ambulance services and volunteer rescue squads under 35 PA.C.S. §7378.1 (related to referendum for additional indebtedness) to include loans to municipal fire departments or companies that provide services through paid personnel and emergency medical services companies for the purpose of establishing and modernizing facilities to house apparatus equipment, ambulances and rescue vehicles, and for purchasing apparatus equipment, ambulances and rescue vehicles, protective and communications equipment and any other accessory equipment necessary for the proper performance of the duties of the fire companies and emergency medical services companies?"</em></p>
      <h3>What is the current system?</h3>
      <p>Only volunteer fire and EMS companies are able to apply for loans from the state.</p>
      <h3>What caused the change?</h3>
      <p>The General Assembly referred a constitutional amendment to the ballot deeming that "a major emergency threatens or is about to threaten the state" and that paid EMS and municipal fire departments need to update their facilities and equipment.</p>
      <h3>If passed, what would it do?</h3>
      <p>This would allow for paid municipal fire departments and EMS companies to access loans for these upgrades without expanding the total amount of money available</p>
      <h3>Yes/For the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows paid municiapl fire and EMS companies to apply for loans</li>
        <li>Allows for greater budget flexiblity for paid fire and EMS companies</li>
        <li>Allows the upgrading or replacement of fire and EMS equipment and facilities</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>No/Against the Measure Arguments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increases the number of applicants and the acceptance rate for loans while not increasing the amount of total funds in the program</li>
        <li>Could lead to budget constriction for volunteer fire and EMS departments</li>
        <li>Expands demands on the State Fire Commissioner's office that administers and provides these grants without increasing funds to the office</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote yes for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting YES means that you DO SUPPORT allowing paid EMS and fire departments to be added to the recipient pool of these loans without increasing the total amount allocated in the pool.</p>
      <h3>What does it mean to vote no for the ballot question?</h3>
      <p>Voting NO means that you DO NOT SUPPORT allowing paid EMS and fire departments to be added to the recipient pool of these loans without increasing the total amount allocated in the pool.</p>
