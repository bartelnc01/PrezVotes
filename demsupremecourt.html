    <h1>Supreme Court Candidates on the Democrat Ticket</h1>
    <h2><em>You can only vote for these candidates if you are a registered Democrat</em></h2>
    <p><em>Please note that there may be more candidates on your ballot. These candidates are the ones who, as of 5/7/21, have not dropped out of the race</em></p>
    <h3>What does this court do?</h3>
      <p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is a 7 member body that rules on cases presented to them by the Pennsylvania Appellate Court (where people go to appeal their case at a lower level). They get about 3,000 court requests a year from the appellate courts to rule on. They also have boards and committees to enforce rules for lower level courts and attorneys. The only court to overturn the PA Supreme Court is the US Supreme Court.</p>

    <p>Along with being our highest appellate court, The Supreme Court overseas our statewide court system and legal community. As such we have the opportunity to set rules, educate the legal community and create special court programs dealing with human services issues like substance abuse & mental health challenges, veteranâ€™s issues & initiatives focused on autism.

This is the cornerstone of our legal system. As a Justice I will not waiver from that driving principle.
