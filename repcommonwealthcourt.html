    <h1>Commonwealth Candidates on the Republican Ticket</h1>
    <h2><em>You can only vote for these candidates if you are a registered Republican</em></h2>
    <p><em>Please note that there may be more candidates on your ballot. These candidates are the ones who, as of 5/7/21, have not dropped out of the race</em></p>
    <h3>What does this court do?</h3>
      <p>This is one of the two intermediate appellate courts (alongside the Superior Court) in Pennsylvania. This 9-judge panel court focuses on actions done by the government and regulatory bodies such as with banking, utility regulation, taxation laws, elections, and labor. It also is where cases filed against the Pennsylvania State Government are heard. Appeals are usually heard only by 3 judges at a time. The president of the Commonwealth Court has a 5 year term and is elected by their colleagues.</p>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>As a sitting Judge I have done all in my power to treat every person that comes before me with respect and fairness. Judges must ensure those with modest means have equal access to justice. We are all created equal but as judges we must insist that all are treated equally or justice is being unfairly denied. Filing fees and other court costs must be waived for those who cannot afford them. Also, quality lawyers must be available to low income individuals free of cost for civil and criminal matters. Further as judges we must ensure that no one perceives that race or wealth or political connections are weighed when a decision is rendered. High ethical standards are vital to instill confidence in the Judiciary.</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>Litigants must be convinced that the Judgeâ€™s personal philosophy does not impede justice. I have also defended the powers of each branch of government since citizens want to be assured that the legislative, executive and judicial branches are not overstepping their constitutional boundaries. Further I try to be a judge that has common sense and treats every person with common decency. Judges must also remain connected to their communities and not be overly isolated. People have more confidence in the Judiciary when they know Judges care about our the same things in our Commonwealth as they do. Judges must have a heightened sense of their words and actions in the courtroom. Both must be beyond reproach.</p>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>As a judge, I must ensure that every person that comes before the Court has the opportunity to be heard. I must rule according to the law without losing sight of the ultimate goal of dispensing justice. I must remove any obstacle which prevents equal access to justice by any means necessary. As a citizen, I can involve myself with organizations and in activities which seek to educate people about the Court, its processes and procedures and to equip them with the knowledge and power to to be able to use the legal system as an advocate for themselves and their interests.</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>Judges set the tone in their courtrooms. They must model fairness, civility, patience and impartiality and demand it from those in their presence. In my courtroom, every voice will be heard and my decisions will be rooted in the law and cloaked in compassion and the urgency to do what is right. I must conduct a daily heart check to ensure that I am not bringing any biases with me that may interfere with my ability to render impartial decisions. I must call out injustice when it occurs...every time. In the community, I can educate others about their rights and the status of the law. I should regularly attend implicit bias trainings and require my staff to do the same, to ensure that fairness is not just a mantra but embedded in my core.
