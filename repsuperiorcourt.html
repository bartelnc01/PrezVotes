    <h1>Superior Court Candidates on the Republican Ticket</h1>
    <h3>What does this court do?</h3>
    <p>This is one of the two intermediate appellate courts (alongside the Commonwealth Court) in Pennsylvania. This 3 judge court rules on cases that are appealed from the Courts of Common Pleas (county level courts). Most of the time, this court is the final ruling on these appeals unless it is taken up by the PA Supreme Court.</p>
    <h2><em>You can only vote for these candidates if you are a registered Republican</em></h2>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>I believe equal access to justice is essential to maintaining trust in our courts and our justice system's legitimacy. I am committed to providing all individuals in my courtroom with equal access to justice by ensuring their voice is heard, their rights are protected, & that they are never subject to discrimination. I support efforts to enhance equal access to justice through legal aid programs that provide individuals with access to qualified attorneys. Providing interpreters for those individuals for whom English is a second language is also important. It is also important to give Individuals with disabilities full access to the courtroom. Everyone that comes before a judge should fully understand their constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>I have a deep respect for our Constitution and our system of justice. I have spent a large part of my 20-year career as an attorney helping others to navigate both the criminal and civil judicial system. I respect the system but understand why some fear it. Individuals who serve in the role of a judge must recognize that they are the arbiter of the rules and the process. This is a great power that requires objectivity, an innate sense of fairness, and humility. I possess these traits and am committed to delivering to all citizens a justice system that shows respect and fairness, as well as knowledgeable decision-making that takes into account the parties' perspectives and applies the law objectively.
