    <h2><em>You can only vote for these candidates if you are a registered Republican</em></h2>
    <h3>What does this court do?</h3>
      <p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is a 7 member body that rules on cases presented to them by the Pennsylvania Appellate Court (where people go to appeal their case at a lower level). They get about 3,000 court requests a year from the appellate courts to rule on. They also have boards and committees to enforce rules for lower level courts and attorneys. The only court to overturn the PA Supreme Court is the US Supreme Court.</p>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>On the Bench-A judge should ensure that people have access to our courts and adequate legal representation. A judge should also be patient with pro se litigants during court proceedings. A judge must also ensure that any and all available resources provided within the court system by distributed to all people equally.<br/><br/>
      Off the Bench-A judge should get involved in assisting with community, social, professional and/or religious groups to help assist with programs that provided equal access to justice.</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>On The Bench-I think the best thing that a judge can do to ensure a fair and equitable court is to follow the law. Our rule of law and our Constitutions are important because they are the foundation of our democracy. If a nation fails to honor its own laws, then we fail as a society.<br/><br/>
      Off The Bench-A judge should be involved in community service and willing to educate people about their rights and responsibilities under the law when appropriate.</p>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>I would work cooperatively with the governor and the legislature to increase funding for legal aid programs. While in private practice, I created a program in Dauphin County to expand pro bono opportunities for lawyers to provide services to nonprofit organizations. I would encourage county bar associations to think creatively about expanding pro bono service to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits. I want to ensure our courts have access to interpreters for parties with limited English proficiency. I would build upon the excellent work of Philadelphia Legal Assistance with respect to the representation of low-wage workers and the unemployed by engaging law schools and other legal aid associations throughout the state.
    </p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>I believe I have earned a reputation as a fair and impartial arbiter of the law. I treat everyone who enters my courtroom, or has a matter before me, with equal respect and dignity. I strive to appreciate the perspectives and points of view of all parties. It is important to me that every litigant, represented and unrepresented, be given every opportunity, within the rules and the law, to present their case. Moreover, as a former Chair of the Pa. Judicial Conduct Board, I am keenly aware of how important it is to Pennsylvanians that our judges observe the highest ethical standards on and off the bench. I hold myself to this high standard. All Pennsylvanians deserve to have faith in a fair and impartial judiciary.

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>As judge and in career, I work with programs that promote restorative and equal justice. The foundational precepts of One Nation under God,"... with liberty and justice for all" must be ensured. I have volunteered: as instructor/faith-based jail program which reduces recidivism to 8-12%; with at-risk youth programs; to help implement residential drug addiction center; to help implement free legal speaker series for those released from incarceration; Chr./App. Ct Proc. Rules Committee/ system more user friendly; cmte.law students to represent pro se parties in UC; educate public to process; cmte./Human trafficking diversion ct. I will fight for openness of all courts for those in need or wronged by the justice system. Art.I,sec.11 Pa,Const.
    </p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>I abide by oath to be fair and impartial and uphold rule of law and Constitutions of PA and USA. To ensure impartiality I did not take money donations from attys. or pacs when I ran for judge of Commonwealth Ct. of PA and I am not taking them for Supreme Ct of PA. I did not take controversial 2005 pay raise and for first 10 yr term on Cmwlth.Ct. gave mthly checks to state treasurer due to pay raise totaling over $10,000.00 dollars of after tax money returned to treasurer. Sentencing practices must be fair and transparent, not disproportionate; vIctims treated with dignity; implement faith-based programs that holistically address underlying issues (e.g. addiction,abuse,anger). I will uphold justice and oppose partisanship or abuse in system
