    <h1>Commonwealth Candidates on the Democrat Ticket</h1>
    <h2><em>You can only vote for these candidates if you are a registered Democrat</em></h2>
    <p><em>Please note that there may be more candidates on your ballot. These candidates are the ones who, as of 5/4/21, have not dropped out of the race</em></p>
    <h3>What do this court do?</h3>
      <p>This is one of the two intermediate appellate courts (alongside the Superior Court) in Pennsylvania. This 9-judge panel court focuses on actions done by the government and regulatory bodies such as with banking, utility regulation, taxation laws, elections, and labor. It also is where cases filed against the Pennsylvania State Government are heard. Appeals are usually heard only by 3 judges at a time. The president of the Commonwealth Court has a 5 year term and is elected by their colleagues.</p>

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>As a judge, I use my position to promote systems change that ensure that all people have more accessibility to the courts. As a Judicial Fellow, I am using those resources to study the statistics over the year of the pandemic to understand whether the use of advanced technology communications increased participation in the court process. Often times, people with limited resources face additional obstacles inherent with our established court processes. Further, we can ensure that everyone in our community has equal access to the court regardless of how you look, who you love, the language you speak and your socio-economic status. Off the bench, judges should participate in the community as a stakeholder to promote the above matters.
    </p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>Judges must continue to be active members of the community. In order to understand how the court is perceived, one must be accessible and engage in intentional dialogue to understand all the people that we serve. Judges must continue to be trained in explicit and implicit bias as it relates to all aspect of the existing court system, and be open to discussing and participating in the changes identified to make the courts more equitable and fair. I recently participated in a national panel to address the racial disparities that exist in the child welfare system. On the bench, we must continue to serve as a servant leader and hold ourselves as well as our colleagues accountable for inequities.

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>As a judge, I must ensure that every person that comes before the Court has the opportunity to be heard. I must rule according to the law without losing sight of the ultimate goal of dispensing justice. I must remove any obstacle which prevents equal access to justice by any means necessary. As a citizen, I can involve myself with organizations and in activities which seek to educate people about the Court, its processes and procedures and to equip them with the knowledge and power to to be able to use the legal system as an advocate for themselves and their interests.</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>Judges set the tone in their courtrooms. They must model fairness, civility, patience and impartiality and demand it from those in their presence. In my courtroom, every voice will be heard and my decisions will be rooted in the law and cloaked in compassion and the urgency to do what is right. I must conduct a daily heart check to ensure that I am not bringing any biases with me that may interfere with my ability to render impartial decisions. I must call out injustice when it occurs...every time. In the community, I can educate others about their rights and the status of the law. I should regularly attend implicit bias trainings and require my staff to do the same, to ensure that fairness is not just a mantra but embedded in my core.

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>The greatest obstacle to justice is access to adequate representation for the indigent population and moderate to low income families. In my previous roles as an Assistant Public Defender, Family Court Hearing Officer and Chief Counsel at a nonprofit organization, I witnessed firsthand the lack of access to justice for many individuals and did my best to help fill in the gaps. As a judge, I can now make sure all parties have competent counsel/representation regardless of socio-economic status before proceeding in any matter that comes before me. Defendants should be able to participate in their own defense and pro se litigants should be provided proper guidance as they navigate the legal system.
</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>Additionally, I can make sure that everyone is treated fairly in court regardless of race, gender, orientation, etc. I am certainly sensitive to and keenly aware of unique issues faced by marginalized populations. As stewards of justice, judges should adhere to and apply the strictest rule of law while also championing inclusion and diversity. This will only strengthen our institutions.

    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice?</h2>
    <p>I am running for Commonwealth Court because I know the importance of checks and balances, and judicial integrity. I have the compassion and the experience to join the court providing a dedicated work ethic and clear comprehension of judicial process. “There should never be an attitude of ‘less important’ cases, each case deserves a complete meritorious review.” I am one of 2000 nationally recognized labor attorneys. My career is not based on being a "rainmaker" for profits, but to guarantee worker's safety and dignitary. When individuals enter a courtroom they should feel confident the judges reflect their values and believe they have been heard. As a civil and Human Rights manager, this is what I do every day.
</p>
    <h2>What can you do, both on and off the bench, to ensure an equitable and fair court?</h2>
    <p>You must immerse yourself in service to your community. In 2020, I was selected by Mayor Peduto to serve on the Pittsburgh Community Task Force for Police Reform. I served on the Board of the Women's Law Project, and Pittsburgh United. When elected to Allegheny County Council, I was Chair of the Committee on Economic Development and Housing, I also served on the Budget and Finance Committee, and Committee on Government Reform. I understand the value of volunteer time. My experiences have prepared me to be fair and impartial. Everyday at work I fight for human rights and civil rights. Judges have an obligation to their community to be a humble and thoughtful judge. Equal justice for all requires an understanding of all citizens.
